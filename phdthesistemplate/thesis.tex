% Yue Li, July 2020

% This template is adapted from the previous template I wrote in 2017:
% University of Nottingham Thesis and Dissertation Template
% https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-nottingham-thesis-and-dissertation-template

% The current one includes more sample scripts in Chapter 4 Main Chapter, demonstrating the use of
% - Figures
% - Tables
% - Lists (for Research Questions and Hypotheses, etc.)
% - and PDF appendix in the Appendix chapter 

% This one is specifically shaped for a PhD thesis submission.
% However, please double check with your faculty's thesis submission guideline.

% LENGTH AND PRESENTATION OF PhD THESIS
% The PhD thesis is normally about 80,000 words in length with an upper word-limit of 100,000 words. The Quality Manual states that ‘The thesis should not be more than 100,000 words in the case of PhD (inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables, and bibliography); the University may withhold from examination a thesis that exceeds these word limits.'
% Your thesis/dissertation must be presented on A4 paper, single-sided, with 12 font typescript, with double spacing, and good quality printing to allow for reproduction. There should be a margin of at least 1.5 inches, preferably 2 inches (5cm), on the left side of the page, both for typescript and diagrams, to allow for binding. Other margins should be of at least 1 inch (2.5 cm).
